Welcome to my homemade **LCR Meter Project**!  

This project demonstrates how to build and test an LCR meter using Python, Streamlit, and a simple audio interface for signal generation.  
It is aimed at **beginners** who want to learn about electronics, impedance measurement, and Python-based data visualization.

# --- What is an LCR Meter ---
st.header("üîé What is an LCR Meter?")
st.markdown("""
An **LCR Meter** measures the following properties of an electronic component:

- **L**: Inductance (Henry, H)  
- **C**: Capacitance (Farad, F)  
- **R**: Resistance (Ohm, Œ©)  

It works by applying a known AC signal to a component and measuring the voltage and current response.

# --- How this project works ---
st.header("‚öôÔ∏è How My LCR Meter Works")
st.markdown("""
1. **Generate a signal**: We use a sine wave with a user-defined frequency, amplitude, and duration.  
2. **Inject the signal**: Send the signal through the unknown load.  
3. **Measure response**: Capture the resulting voltage/current waveform.  
4. **Calculate impedance**: Use phasor relationships to compute R, L, or C.  
5. **Display results**: Show measured values, errors, and statistics.

st.markdown("""
- Start by understanding **AC signals and phasors**.  
- Use **small test components** when measuring, like 1kŒ© resistors or 10¬µF capacitors.  
- Adjust **frequency and amplitude** carefully to avoid saturating your ADC/sound card.  
- Print **plots of your waveform** to understand the signal behavior.
